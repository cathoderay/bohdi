A tool to help us practice mindful writing and stay in the present moment.

Motivation
==========
We live in a world of distractions in which we're constantly interrupted.
This constant stimulation makes our sympathetic nervous system overwhelmed
and stress is not properly released, impairing our overall health.

Unique features
==============
0. it runs in fullscreen and there are no buttons, icons or menus
    This helps us focus.
    To exit, just press `Esc`.

1. there's no option to go back
    We cannot use Backspace, Left Arrow or Up Arrow keys.
    This helps us focus and slow down.
    When we slow down we are more calm and relaxed.

2. there's no option to save the work
    This helps us practice detachment.
    If you need to save your work, it's probably because you want to
    revisit it in the future. This means you're not fully in the
    present moment.
    Buddhism teaches that attachment is a primary cause
    of suffering (dukkha). By releasing attachments, one can reduce
    suffering and experience greater peace and happiness.

I hope it helps.

Have a nice day! =)
